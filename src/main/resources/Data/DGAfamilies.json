Its primary characteristic was the sophisticated P2P-based C&C protocol and it is said to be a further development of the file infecting Zeus variant LICAT / Murofret. It also used a [DGA as backup](https://www.abuse.ch/?p=3499). The DGA calculated 1000 domains based on time. The validity interval start was 'weeks' with respect to the day of month, thus each interval starting on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th and the domains being valid for usually 7 days if it was not the end of the month.
